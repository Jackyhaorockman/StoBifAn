TPA/Examples
===

We provide here several examples for the tensor-structured parametric analysis. For the methodology, please refer to:

Liao, S., Vejchodsky, T. & Erban, R. (2014). [Parameter estimation and bifurcation analysis of stochastic models of gene regulatory networks: tensor-structured methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7825). arXiv preprint arXiv:1406.7825.

Note: We are still commenting and uploading parts of the coding templates, and should be completed in a couple of weeks. For more inquiries, please email liao@maths.ox.ac.uk.
